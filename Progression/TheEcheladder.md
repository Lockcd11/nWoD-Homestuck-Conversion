# The Echeladder
The Echeladder is the funny little chart that represents your character progression in homestuck. It may or may not be part of sburb? What about boonbucks? Idk man.  
I'm using it for the nWoD supernatural power stat.  

Name your echeladder rungs. It'll be fun.

Your rung is also the highest level Classpect Ability available to you.

| Rung | Max Grist | Max Complexity | Additional Effects | Example To Reach |
|------|-----------|----------------|--------------------|----------|
| 1    | 5         | 3              |The Basic Echeladder|You start here goofus|
| 2    | 6         | 3              |                    |Defeat your 1st imp|
| 3    | 7         | 3              |                    |Defeat portal ogre|
| 4    | 8         | 4              |                    |Defeat 1st team boss|
| 5    | 9         | 5              |                    |Defeat Denizen?|
| 6    | 10        | 6              |The God Tiers       |Die Properly|
| 7    | 15        | 7              |                    | |
| 8    | 25        | 8              |                    | |
| 9    | 50        | 9              |                    | |
| 10   | 100       | 10             |                    | |

Rather than increasing your echeladder rung by spending experience, it's based on reaching milestones. Examples are given, but feel free to replace them or use experience like any other nWoD major template.
Note that defeat based milestones do not count kills as the server player. They do count teamwork in person.
