# AntiSpecialties

AntiSpecialties represent things your character a knowledgable about, and theoretically skilled at, but is prone to catastrophic misexecution for whatever reason. Things like Karkat's hacking, or Equius' Archery.

AntiSpecialties have a similar design to specialties, and anything that can be chosen as a specialty can be chosen as an AntiSpecialty, with the same scope, (note that you must still have a dot in the base skill to take an AntiSpeciaty, there's nothing special about failing something you're bad at)

On a roll that includes an AntiSpecialty, if the number of 1s rolled is equal to or greater than successes, the result is a dramatic failure, regardless of the number of successes.

Some AntiSpecialties are gained during character generation, but more may be gained through equipment or progression.

Example: Greg trains every day and claims to be an expert in Parkour, unfortunately, he's known to absolutely fuck it up and eat shit on the pavement under pressure. When he attempts to climb a building to gain access to a Prospitian Prison Window, his AntiSpecialty in parkour engages. His Roll of 1, 1, 4, 8, 9 has two successes, great! Unfortunately, it also has two 1s. At least the fall damage to his dream self might knock him out, waking him up to deal with other problems.
