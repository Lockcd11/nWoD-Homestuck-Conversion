# Draw and Flaw

World of Darkness Virtue and Vice system is great, pushing players to have their characters engage in the worst parts of their characters for an easy source of Willpower, or engaging with their Virtue to regain plenty of willpower at the cost of inconveniencing themselves and possibly others.

This doesn't tonally work with homestuck (at least the way I read it, feel free to not use Draw and Flaw if you prefer a darker tone), so instead, Draw and Flaw fill similar roles for regaining willpower.

## Draw
Your character's draw is what makes them easy to be friends with, it's the reason everyone keeps them around. Think Jade's genuine positivity, or Dave's sense of humor.

With the same frequency as a vice, your character may engage in their Draw to give a point of willpower to another player. Thanks Bud. This point of willpower may be declined by the other player if their character refuses to engage. (For example, if they "Aren't in the mood for your bullshit right now")

## Flaw
Your character is unfortunately, a bit of a mess. Your flaw is one of the primary ways this can manifest. Think John's tantrum spirals, or Vriska's relentless bullshit.

With the same frequency as a virtue, your character may engage with their Flaw to regain all their points of willpower. This should come at either significant inconvenience to yourself, or at least moderate inconvenience to some other party members.
