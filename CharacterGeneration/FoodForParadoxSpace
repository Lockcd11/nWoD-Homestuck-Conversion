## The things we need to weave the jokes, and craft the world

### Some kind of guy
Your character should have a variety of INTERESTS. They have things they're good at and things they're bad at, but also things they wish they were good at, and things that they only think that they're bad at.  
Remember that every item you have in your house may be interacted with by your server player. Have a few things that will be interesting to prototype lying around.  
Think about your relationships with the others in your house. Think about your relationships with the other characters. Do you know them? How well? For how long?  
What did you get them for their birthday? Why?  
You'll want enough things to work with that you can start to generate your own in jokes. A rich meme field to plow for content. Make your friends laugh.  
What's your favorite thing about each other character?  What annoys you?  

Are you playing a human, a troll, or something else?  Think about the ways that would change you. Think about what it means for your guardian, and your friendships.

### Where have you been stuck?
Your character lives SOMEWHERE. Probably some variant of HOUSE. Make it feel like a home. What does your room have in it? Who else lives there? Just you and your Guardian?  
Discuss with the storyteller if they're going to die, if you're thinking of prototyping them, and the consequences mechanically and narratively if you do or dont.  
This place is your home, does it feel like it? Why? Why not?  What cool shit does your guardian leave lying around?  What's the gaudiest bit of decor?  
Are there many pictures up?  How is your room different from the rest of the house? How is your guardian's room different?  
What does your guardian understand about you that you don't yet understand about yourself?  What don't they understand yet?  What assumptions do you have about their life?

### Are you going somewhere with this?
Class and Aspect in homestuck are not just your skillset and abilities, they imply a story to tell.  

What is it your character needs to learn? What is it your character thinks they need to learn?  

What are the beats of your in-game quest? What story do they tell? What metaphors are you being clubbed with, and which are subtle?  

What does your class mean to you?  What will it mean at the end? Is it a natural fit, or a struggle?  

How do you embody your aspect? How do you differ?
