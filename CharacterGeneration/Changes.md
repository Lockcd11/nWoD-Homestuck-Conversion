# Changes

## The Basics
Character generation works similarly to base nWoD, with a few core changes.

- Replace Virtue and Vice with Draw and Flaw
- When choosing your specialties, also choose an AntiSpecialty
- Choose a Class and an Aspect
- Choose your Strife Specibus

### Draw and Flaw
Your draw is what makes being friends with your character worthwhile. It's the primary positive force you provide to other's lives. Your flaw is what makes being friends with your character difficult, and can inconvenience yourself and others.

See the section in mechanical changes for the effects of Draw and Flaw.

Example: Jess goes above and beyond to help her friends. Her Draw is supportive, and when she personally assists another character, they really feel that connection. Unfortunately, her Flaw is Stubborn, once she's helping, she won't give up until the task is complete, if this causes enough of a problem, Jess can regain all her willpower.

### AntiSpecialty
During character generation, your character gains an AntiSpecialty. This is something they really wish they were good at, (and maybe they even believe they are). They are not. No matter how hard they try (Oh my god do they try), they can't get it down.

See the section in mechanical changes for the effects of an AntiSpecialty.

### Class and Aspect
During character generation, choose a class and an aspect. Think about the meaning of the "classpect" you have chosen, and the story it implies your character will tell. Work with your gm here to discuss the implications of the classpect, and the exact interpretation of it that you are envisioning.

### Strife Specibus
By default, your character begins with a single weapon in their strife portfolio. This is the only weapon type they can wield. If you would like, you can wait until your character first grabs an object to defend themself with to decide on this. Note that certain weapon classes may have style merits available, such as PuppetKind or FncySntaKind. (In theory any weapon class may have style merits, but not all will necessarily be made by me)
