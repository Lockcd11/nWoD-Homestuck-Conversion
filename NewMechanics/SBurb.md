## The end of the world as we know it
Do feel free to fuck around with the usual Sburb format, server/client loops etc. Especially if it can help with the story.

But by default, after you've generated some characters, some poor bastard will start their client, and some other prick will be their server. 

I think the usual string of bullshit might be fun, especially so that you can gently introduce everyone to the mechanics one at a time, and give every character a little bit of focussed time to build their personality (Many characters don't really get their voice and personality until they've done some things).

Your canon-standard pre generated encounter is easy enough to run, but remember to be lenient with the timer. Meteors can be used to encourage players to get back on task, but a true failure state this early on is probably not a good idea. (See the section on DEATH that hasn't been made yet).

Whenever the currently focussed client player is knocked unconscious, starts a task that may take some time, or it'd be really funny, (or if you just think it's time) shift the focus to their server player (or another player, whatever works). Have fun with it. Get everyone in the medium somehow, don't be too clever here if the players aren't comfy yet. Simple, standard gameplay.

### Things you'll probably want to force in some way:
- At least one interaction with a guardian.
- Put something in the dang kernelsprite. This is important. (Null and Void sessions might be what you want, don't let me stop you. Hell, the storyteller may have something even crazier in mind)
- Computer location management. The location of every computer in your house may be relevant when you're the server. What's the wifi situation?  
- Increasing the height of the house. That first portal won't reach itself.  

## Being the server
This is where things get weird. If you have computer access, you can do server player things. You may gain a bonus or penalty to your inititative based on your internet connection. (if it's really spotty, you may miss turns here and there).  

### Server Player Abilities
While acting as the server player, you can do the following actions within the house of the client. You also know the location of the client if they are within the house or its immediate vicinity, and can see the area from an isometric angle, ignoring walls and ceilings as required.
#### Changing the environment
Adding or removing objects or terrain is an action that uses Wits and Computers. Difficulty 1 is for simple things like adding a window, or extending a wall. Difficulty 2 is ensuring a door can be opened when placed, difficulty 4 is anything involving stairs. If you fail, you create difficult terrain, based on how hard you fucked it. If you fail to make a useable door, it's gotta be squeezed through. I think we've all been warned about the other thing by now. In general, adding new things costs grist equal to the difficulty.  
Recycling uses int and composure. For each success, gain a grist. Your client will not thank you. You are destroying their house. 
#### Moving stuff around
Moving objects around without causing collateral damage is a dex+drive check (yes, drive), difficulty scales based on the size of the item and the potential hazards.
Dropping things on other things for fun, profit, or violence is a wits+drive check. Damage is based on the size of the thing.
