# The Medium and Dreaming
When your character gets knocked the fuck out (or falls asleep for other reasons), they usually awaken on one of skaia's moons as their dream self.
How "conscious" a dream self is depends on a few things, but at the very least, most dreamers aren't fully aware until the game is properly underway.

Whether your character is a prospit or derse dreamer has primarily narrative effects, with the primary mechanical effect being your ability to commune with either Skaia (for Prospit dreamers), or the HorrorTerrors of the Furthest Ring (for Derse Dreamers).

Characters from Prospit may meditate using presence and expression, to interpret the clouds of skaia for hints and bonuses.

Characters from Derse may meditate using wits and occult, to commune with the horrorterrors for hints and boons.

When a character becomes unconscious due to damage, they wake up as their dream self, (or as their physical self if their dream self is knocked out).

If your physical self is killed, and the body is kissed within the scene, you awaken fully as your dream self.

If your physical self is killed on your quest bed, your dream self ascends to God Tier.

If your dream self is killed on a crypt bed, it ascends to God Tier.

Sleeping whilst one of your selves is dead will send you to the Dream Bubbles (Content pending).

## Quest Beds and Crypt Beds
Don't let the players find these until the story is ready. I don't care how hard they look, or if they can prove they should be able to find them. These bad boys are narrative.

## The Moons
Prospit and Derse each have their own governmental system that should be fleshed out as appropriate to the game. I plan on including them much more heavily in my game, because it's really the only place to get game NPCs of a moderate level of power and agency.

Each moon contains portals to the outer ring, and to the battlefield. Searching for a portal is a wits + investigation/survival check.

Finding a portal to the battlefield is difficulty 2, to the furthest ring is difficulty 3, to your own moon is difficulty 1, and to the opposing moon is difficulty 4. The storyteller may also place portals in locations at will. If it bothers you enough, add portal finding to your kiddy camper handy sash.

### Prospit
Prospit is a bright, friendly place and contains the white carapacians. It's within spitting distance of skaia, which gives prospit dreamers occasional cryptic glimpses into the future.

Skaian knowlege should be esoteric and ethereal, more implication and tone than anything else. Write it down. If something happens later that reminds you of it, you can spend it to gain a one dice bonus on a roll involving that. Good for you bud!

### Derse
Derse is a grim, dark place and contains the black carapacians. It's within spitting distance of the furthest ring, allowing derse dreamers to say hi to things best not said hi to.

HorrorTerror knowledge should be eldritch and directed, an actionable request that information can be gleaned from. Write it down. When you complete the request, you recieve a boon. Consequences may vary.

### The Furthest Ring
An asteroid belt, slowly being torn apart to form the reckoning. Also the cloning vats and shipyards for the vast forces of Prospit and Derse. Great place for ectobiology, or being haunted.

### The Battlefield
A Vast, horrifically complex chessboard, and the site of the majority of the combat in the war between the moons. The battlefield is vast, and almost impossible to understand to the human mind. A place of terrible things, especially once the reckoning really gets going. Great place for seeing little chess men experience the unspeakable horrors of war.
