# Punch Card Alchemy

## Overview
Each session/downtime (we'll see how this goes in playtesting), characters with access to alchemy equipment will have the opportunity to do some good old fashioned alchemy. With punch cards etc.
Let the storyteller know what two ingredients you're using. They will tell you the complexity of those ingredients.
### Ingredience
Ingredients will have a level of complexity at the discretion of the storyteller. In general, combining complex ingredients will give even more complex items.
### Success and Failure
Alchemy is a Crafting and Intelligence roll, with difficulty equal to the highest complexity ingredient. On a success, the storyteller will create for you some kind of item, be it a weapon, or some apparel. The item may have stat bonuses or penalties, and may even grant other things, like specialties, or unique abilities.
On a dramatic success, you may give the storyteller the concept for them to build (Ie. weapon, basic idea of how that weapon would function).
On a failure, you create Some Garbage. This is an item that is still a combination of the two ingredients, but not an immediately useful or practical one. It may still be used if you think of a way, and may certainly be recombined as ingredients later.
On a dramatic failure, you make something horrid. Duttle tier. It's uncomfortable and bad. You get a -1 dice penalty to all alchemy until you find a way to get rid of this thing. Jegus.
### Fucking about
You can! Experiment! Who knows what worldbuilding hints attempts to combine various objects will give!
### Grist?
Grist will likely be spendable to get bonuses on crafting, or may even be required to use crafting materials of a certain complexity. Some items may even require specific grist, that will need to be found in a location! Fetch quests as desired!
### Keywords!
Invent them!

Here's some concepts:  
- Radioactive: Damage from radioactive sources takes twice as long to heal, radioactive attire prevents natural healing.  
- Very Radioactive: as Radioactive, AND: if an entity has at least one unhealed point of damage from a Very Radioactive source, they have -1 Stamina, very radioactive attire deals 1 bashing to the user per day.  
- Really fucking sharp: Damage from Really fucking sharp sources ignores a point of armor. Really fucking sharp attire deals a point of lethal (ignoring armor) to the wearer whenever they dramatically fail a physical skill check (or any check if its funny)  
- Robust: Robust sources deal an additional point of bashing damage whenever they deal bashing damage. Robust attire makes the wielder immune to low level dangerous terrain.
