# Classes

## Overview

#### On gendered classes
Don't worry about it
#### On speculation
We don't have proper canon descriptions for all the classes, so I'm doing some interpretation, but if you have your own interpretation, go ham with it bud! If it forms a story it's free game. The only Classes with canon descriptions/pairs are Thief/Rogue and Bard/Prince. Many interpretations are given for most classes, but the lists are by no means exhaustive.
