# Classes

## Overview

#### On gendered classes
Don't worry about it
#### On speculation
We don't have proper canon descriptions for all the classes, so I'm doing some interpretation, but if you have your own interpretation, go ham with it bud! If it forms a story it's free game. The only Classes with canon descriptions/pairs are Thief/Rogue and Bard/Prince (And like even then do what you want, I'm a nerd not a cop). Many interpretations are given for most classes, but the lists are by no means exhaustive.

### Thief
> One who steals or steals from [Aspect] to benefit themself  
#### Speculation Zone
Thieves cannot grow or heal their aspect. They can gain it for themselves, but only by taking it from others. Any attempt to give it should backfire narratively.
#### Mechanics
Powers should focus on taking things away from others, and buffing yourself.
Debuffs/SelfBuffs
##### Starting Skill
Thieves start with a dot in larceny or stealth

### Rogue
> One who steals or steals from [Aspect] to benefit others  
#### Speculation Zone
#### Mechanics
Powers should focus on taking things away from others, and buffing others.
Debuffs/buffs
##### Starting Skill
Rogues start with a dot in larceny or stealth

### Bard
> One who allows destruction of or invites destruction through [Aspect]  
#### Speculation Zone
Boy this sure is one of the classes of all time.
#### Mechanics
Active bard abilities shoud be very powerful, but should never be easy to use.
Passive abilities are where bards can be very strong. But never helpful, always destructive.
##### Starting Skill
Bards start with a dot in intimidation or expression

### Prince
> One who destroys or destroys with [Aspect]  
#### Speculation Zone
Honestly, this is the easiest class of all to understand, even in it's most metaphorical.
#### Mechanics
Active powerful abilities, no passives here. Damage (not necessarily physical) rather than buffs.
##### Starting Skill
Princes start with a dot in intimidation or a dot in a combat skill (Weapons, Athletics, Brawl, Firearms, Computers if you can justify it)

### Heir
> One who invites change through [Aspect]  
> One who is consumed by, embodies, or is surrounded by [Aspect]  
> One who's behaviour and existence is controlled by and expected to represent [Aspect]  
> One who manipulates or changes [Aspect] (Likely paired with witch)  
> One who inherits or recieves [Aspect]  
#### Speculation Zone
#### Mechanics
Self change to gain traits of the aspect (literal or metaphorical)
Summon large quantities of the aspect (literal)
##### Starting Skill


### Page
> One who creates or provides [Aspect] for others  
> One who serves or serves through [Aspect]  
> One who is exploited by or through [Aspect]  
> One who comes to serve [Aspect]  
#### Speculation Zone
Pages often begin with a major defecit in their aspect
Pages are often stated to be a class that starts very weak, but has a lot of potential. Mechanically, a Page should not have powerful abilities until late. Make them suffer.
#### Mechanics
If a page has not fully come into their own, their abilities should be bad. I mean this. Throw balance out the window for these guys. If they get there it's worth it, and if not, it's funny. Page players need to know what they're signing up for, but there's a kind of player they're perfect for.
Pages should not start with the usual aspect ability. Instead, they should start with some kind of Aspect detriment. Examples may be listed who knows.
##### Starting Skill
For the moment, I don't think they get one. I could be convinced otherwise, but I think it's funny.

### Seer
> One who understands or understands through [Aspect] for others  
#### Speculation Zone
#### Mechanics
Supportive information based upsides. Let your party know what the enemy is up to, or how best to deploy.
Spymaster builds, divination builds, researcher builds.
##### Starting Skill
Witches start with a dot in a mental or social skill of their choice (but they do have to justify it within their element). (I would allow a physical skill with justification also)

### Maid
> One who creates or creates through [Aspect] for others  
> One who protects or cleans [Aspect]  
> One who gives [Aspect]  
#### Speculation Zone
#### Mechanics
The mechanics for a maid will depend a LOT on how you're interpreting them, and can be quite freeform even then. Group passives and aspect based crowd control.
##### Starting Skill
Maids start with a dot in crafts or expression.

### Sylph
> One who heals or heals through [Aspect] for others  
#### Speculation Zone
#### Mechanics
No direct buffs, but repair based abilities. Can't improve things unless they are already damaged (but once they are damaged, the sky is the limit)
##### Starting Skill
Sylphs start with a dot in crafts or medicine

### Knight
> One who serves or serves through [Aspect] for others  
> One who protects or protects others through [Aspect]  
> One who wields [Aspect]  
> One who conceals [Aspect]  
#### Speculation Zone
Knights often represent the thing their session lacks. (Beta Kids have no time, Beta Trolls have no teamwork)
#### Mechanics
Things that let them use their aspect indirectly, movement/positioning abilities (literal or metaphorical), or support use of their aspect.
##### Starting Skill
Knights start with a dot in athletics, or a combat skill of their choice.

### Witch
> One who manipulates [Aspect]  
> One who manipulates or breaks the rules of or with [Aspect]  
#### Speculation Zone
#### Mechanics
Direct aspect control. May be expensive, but should definitely be flashy. Can go completely insane late game. Shatter some assumptions.
##### Starting Skill
Witches start with a dot in a mental or social skill of their choice (but they do have to justify it within their element). (I would allow a physical skill with justification also)

### Mage
> One who knows or knows through [Aspect] for themselves  
> One who benefits from knowledge of [Aspect]  
> One who guides with [Aspect]  
> One who forfeits [Aspect] to gain knowledge  
> One who receives knowledge from [Aspect]  
> One who arms themselves with knowledge of [Aspect]  
> One who is manipulated by [Aspect]  
#### Speculation Zone
#### Mechanics
Self Buffs. Knowing the weaknesses and secrets of the enemy where applicable.
##### Starting Skill
Mages start with a dot in a mental or social skill of their choice (but they do have to justify it within their element). (I would allow a physical skill with justification also)
