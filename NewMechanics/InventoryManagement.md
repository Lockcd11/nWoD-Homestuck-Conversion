# Inventory Management
## The Sylladex
Pick a sylladex, and a number between 0 and 2. This number is the difficulty of picking shit up with your specibus. This is also the damage bonus of weaponising your sylladex (modified for object size)
Eg. Queue - Dif 2, Stack - Dif 1, Array - Dif 0;
Failing a sylladex check causes something funny to happen maybe?
